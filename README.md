**System requirements:**
- 2.4 GHz CPU or faster (multi-core recommended)
- Windows 7, 8 or 10
- Graphics card with OpenGL 3.2 support

**Required software on Windows:**
- [Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)

**Building on Linux:**
- Install mono. On debian based distros `apt-get install mono-complete` should do the trick
- Install gcc
- Type `make`. If you get an error about it not finding `msbuild` then you are most likely missing a package, or your version of mono may be too old
- Run it by launching `builder` from inside the Build folder
